                            About 2,000 miles east of Australia lies a small island country, New Zealand. It consists of two main land masses, North Island and South Island, and over 700 smaller island. These smaller islands are places filled with unique animals that highlight the diversity of evolution. Many are aware of the flightless bird indigenous to New Zealand the Kiwi. In fact, the Kiwi is the national bird of New Zealand and "kiwi" is also a term used to refer to people originating from new Zealand.

                            However, there is another flightless bird endemic to New Zealand. This bird located on Codfish / Whenua Hou and Anchor. This bird is much more rare and in danger of disappearing altogether...

                        The name is derived from the Maori language. "kaka" for "parrot" and "po" for "night". However, you shouldn't call them night parrots. Night Parrots are a bird. By a bizzare evolutionary coincidence, the Night Parrots native to Australia have a very similar coloring and are also endangered. Initially thought to be related, recent research has proved otherwise. A notable difference between the two is average size. The Kakapo ranges from 58 to 64cm (23 to 25in) while the Night parrot tends to be 23cm (9.2in).

                        The Kakapo is one of the longest living birds with a reported lifespan of up to 100 years. The alluring facade fades when one learns they suffer from island syndrome development. Isolated on an island without any natural predators, the Kakapo developed a robust sternum at the expense of flight. Compounding the problem for this land parrot is the fact that they don't run so much as waddle. An energetic and adorable waddle but not keenly suited for survival to threats introduced by the Europeans such as cats and rats. These new predators and over hunting by the native Maoi has left this singular species critically endagered with a total known population of 252.

                        Conservation efforts to save this bird began as early as 1891 but success was limited until the fomration of the Kakapo Recover project in 1995. At the time, the known population had dwindled to a mere 51 living Kakapo. Fortunately, this program has seen success and led to a population recovery. The future looks hopeful for these fellows with the discovery of artifical insemination making a considerable contribution. Steady conservation efforts are still important to increase and maintain these animals.

                        Several sources that I was able to find online indicated that the Kakapo is associated with a "rich history" of Maoi folklore. However, I was only able to find one story. A big thank you to Zalka Csenge Vir√°g and her blog 
                        <a href = "http://multicoloreddiary.blogspot.com/2020/04/k-is-for-kakapo-folktales-of-endangered.html">The Multicolored Diary</a> 
                        for being the sole source of any story available online

                        The Kakapo and Toroa (albatross) argued over which of them should rule over the land. A test of skills was in order and the deciding match a game of hide and seek. Both would take turns hiding and the one who could blend in best wins.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Toroa tried to hide in the open land but his vibrant white feathers easily gave him away. The Kakpo decided to hide amongst the ferns and blended in. He became one with the forest and no matter how much the Albatross search, he was unable to find the Kakapo.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ever since, the Albatross lived flying over the water and about the wide ocean. The Kakapo lived on the land using its colors to blend with the forest.
