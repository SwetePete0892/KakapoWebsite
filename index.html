                            About 2,000 miles east of Australia lies a small island country, New Zealand. It consists of two main land masses, North Island and South Island, and over 700 smaller island. These smaller islands are places filled with unique animals that highlight the diversity of evolution. Many are aware of the flightless bird <i>indigenous</i> to New Zealand the Kiwi.

                        The name is derived from the Maori language. "kaka" for "parrot" and "po" for "night". However, you shouldn't call them night parrots. Night Parrots are a different bird. By a bizzare evolutionary coincidence, the Night Parrots native to Australia have a very similar coloring and are also endangered. Initially thought to be related, recent research has proved otherwise. A notable difference between the two is average size. The Kakapo ranges from 58 to 64cm (23 to 25in) while the Night parrot tends to be 23cm (9.2in).

                        The Kakapo’s binomial name is Strigops Habroptilus. In theory, every species has a two-part scientific name. The first part describes the genus (Strigops) and the second part is specific to the animal (Habroptilus). This standard makes communication easier between scientists around the world!
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Both parts of the Kakapo’s binomial name are derived from Ancient Greek. “Strigos” means owl, “ops” means face, “habros” means soft, and “pitlon” means feather. If taken literally, the name translates to: “Owl face soft feather”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The eyes of the Kakapo face forward which is more common in owls than a parrots. This is where “owl face” comes from. The feathers surrounding the eyes also have a different texture from the rest of the Kakapo resembling whiskers more than feathers. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A relatively short wingspan and lack of flight muscles have rendered the Kakapo flightless. Thus, the feathers do not need the stiffness and strength necessary to fly allowing them to be exceptionally supple and earning Kakapos the specific name “Habroptilus” or “soft feather

                        A kakapo is an expert at hiding among the ferns with its camouflage coloring. The combination of moss-green and yellow mottled with black or a dark brownish make it vanish while stationary. Mottled means spots or smears of color. This pattern is seen in many different animals. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The feathers may be soft, but the feet are certainly not. They are large, scaly and zygodactyl. Thats a fancy way of saying they have two toes facing forward and two toes facing backwards. Making something akin to an ‘X’. This is a trait among all parrots.
                    </p>

                        Kakapos are herbivores- they only eat plants. Kakapos will feed on many different plants including ferns, supplejack vines and orchid tubers. However, their favorite food is the fruit produced by the rimu trees. In fact, Kakapos will only breed during years the fruit is in abundance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Kakapos are excellent climbers. Thanks to their zygodactyl feet they can scale rimu trees of up to 20 meters. While they may be flightless, they use their wings to glide down after climbing trees. This act is known as “parachuting”.

                    <p>
                        A notable sign of Kakapo feeding is called a “chew”. It’s a small, crescent shaped wad. They place their beak at the base of a piece of foliage and pull it through their beak using their feet. What’s left is a quaint ball of fiber.

                        The Kakapo is one of the longest living birds with a reported lifespan of up to 100 years. The alluring facade fades when one learns they suffer from island syndrome development. Isolated on an island without any natural predators, the Kakapo developed a robust sternum at the expense of flight. Compounding the problem for this land parrot is the fact that they don't run so much as waddle. An energetic and adorable waddle but not keenly suited for survival to threats introduced by the Europeans such as cats and rats. These new predators and over hunting by the native Maoi has left this singular species critically endangered with a total known population of 252.

                        Conservation efforts to save this bird began as early as 1891 but success was limited until the formation of the Kakapo Recover project in 1995. At the time, the known population had dwindled to a mere 51 living Kakapo. Fortunately, this program has seen success and led to a population recovery. The future looks hopeful for these fellows with the discovery of artificial insemination making a considerable contribution. Steady conservation efforts are still important to increase and maintain these animals.

                        Several sources that I was able to find online indicated that the Kakapo is associated with a "rich history" of Maoi folklore. However, I was only able to find one story. A big thank you to Zalka Csenge Virág and her blog 
                        <a href = "http://multicoloreddiary.blogspot.com/2020/04/k-is-for-kakapo-folktales-of-endangered.html">The Multicolored Diary</a>

                        The Kakapo and Toroa (albatross) argued over which of them should rule over the land. A test of skills was in order and the deciding match a game of hide and seek. Both would take turns hiding and the one who could blend in best wins.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Toroa tried to hide in the open land but his vibrant white feathers easily gave him away. The Kakpo decided to hide amongst the ferns and blended in. He became one with the forest and no matter how much the Albatross search, he was unable to find the Kakapo.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ever since, the Albatross lived flying over the water and about the wide ocean. The Kakapo lived on the land using its colors to blend with the forest.
